# Contributing to Adventure List 2.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Below are the guidelines to help ensure a smooth workflow and contribution process.

## Branching Strategy

- **Main Branch Protection**:
   The `main` branch is protected. All commits must be made to a non-protected branch and submitted via a pull request before they can be merged into the `main` branch.

### Naming Conventions for Branches

1. **For a new feature**:
    - Branch Name: `feature/yourInitials/feature-name-in-camelCase`.
    - Example: `feature/JS/dashboard`.

2. **For a bugfix**:
    - Branch Name: `bugfix/bug-name`.
    - Example: `bugfix/login-error`.

Ensure that your branch name clearly reflects the nature of the work you'll be doing. This makes it easier for others to understand the purpose of your branch.

## Commit Messages

- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Start the commit message with a capital letter.
- If applicable, specify the area of the codebase the commit pertains to.

## Pull Requests

- Ensure that your code has been tested and is working as expected before creating a pull request.
- Create a pull request from your feature or bugfix branch to the `main` branch.
- Provide a clear description of the changes in the pull request.
- Request reviews from other team members, and address any feedback provided.

## Code Reviews

- Be respectful and provide constructive feedback.
- If you see something you don't understand, or want to learn more about, ask for clarification.

## Code Style

- Follow the coding style and guidelines provided in the project documentation.
- Ensure your code is readable, well-commented, and follows best practices.

## Testing

- Ensure your code is well-tested and that all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Reporting Bugs

- If you find a bug, check existing open and closed GitHub Issues to see if it has already been reported.
- If the bug hasn't been reported, create a new GitHub Issue and provide a clear description of the issue, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
